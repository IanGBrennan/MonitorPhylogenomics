# Phylogenomics of Monitor Lizards

This repository holds associated files and scripts for our manuscript on the phylogenomics of *Varanus* lizards and the evolution of size disparity in a coevolutionary framework. Included are data files and code to replicate phylogenetic comparative analyses of body size evolution and functional diversity. In each folder is an RMarkdown document which will walk you through the desired analyses (*Trait* or *Spatial Evolution*). The easiest thing is to clone this repo and you should have everything you need categorized in the folders below. However, if you are looking for something that I've forgotten to put up, please email me at ian.brennan.anu.edu.au

Otherwise, this repository includes the following (organized under folders of the same names):
